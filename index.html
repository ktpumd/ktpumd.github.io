        <p class="pr-4">
          Welcome to the Epsilon Chapter of Kappa Theta Pi Kappa at the University of Maryland, College Park. Kappa Theta Pi is the worldâ€™s first-co-educational professional technology fraternity. Our mission is to provide guidance to students with a shared interest in technology and to cultivate an environment in which our members can grow in three major dimensions: technical, professional, and social. We seek to provide service and philanthropy to the local community by building relations within the area and with corporations.
          <br>
          With events throughout the year with various companies and organizations, our members are able to develop professional skills and build their network.
          <br>
          Our members come from a variety of backgrounds: computer science, engineering, business, economics, and the arts.
          Kappa Theta Pi UMD is open to all majors -- if you have an interest in tech, you'll fit right in!
